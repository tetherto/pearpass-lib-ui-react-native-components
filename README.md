## 🏗 Core Architecture

This library is built using **React Strict DOM** to provide a strict, web-standards-aligned API that renders as optimized standard HTML/CSS on web/desktop, and maps efficiently to native components on mobile.

## 🚀 Getting Started

We use **Storybook** as the central place to build, test, and preview components locally. 

### Running Storybook

Inside this directory, simply run:

```bash
npm install
npm run storybook
```

This will spin up a local server rendering components using Vite and React DOM. You can preview all states and interactions.

### Running Storybook on Native (iOS/Android)

To preview components on a real device or simulator using React Native:

```bash
cd storybook-native
npm install
```

Then run on iOS or Android:

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run storybook:native:ios
npm run storybook:native:android

# Or from the storybook-native directory
npx expo run:ios
npx expo run:android
```

The native Storybook reuses the same stories as the web version. It runs inside a minimal Expo app located in `storybook-native/`.
